# Movies Recommendations System with Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to build a movie recommendations system using machine learning techniques. A movie dataset is used, which contains information about movies such as title, genre, and user ratings. The goal is to develop a model that can predict and recommend movies to users based on their preferences and historical data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Streamlit

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. Data Preparation: In this section, the movie dataset is loaded and preprocessed. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Here, the dataset is analyzed to gain insights and understand the distribution of movie genres, user ratings, and other relevant features. Visualizations and statistical summaries may be used to explore the data.

3. Model Development: Machine learning algorithms are applied to build a movie recommendations model. This can include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach. The model is trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

4. Deployment: The movie recommendations system is deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The user interface allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Installation and Usage
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Abdalrahman-H/Movie-Recommender-System-ML_Project-.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook movie_recommendations.ipynb
4. Explore the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, EDA, and model development.
5. To deploy the web application, run: streamlit run app.py. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
